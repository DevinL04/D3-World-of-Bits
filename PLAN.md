# D3: {World of Bits}

# Game Design Vision

Location based crafting game where players use the map to find and collect tokens from nearby grid cells. These tokens can be crafted with tokens of the same value to double the worth.

# Technologies

- TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
- Deno and Vite for building
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation

# Assignments

## D3.a: Core mechanics (token collection and crafting)

Key technical challenge: Can you assemble a map-based user interface using the Leaflet mapping framework?
Key gameplay challenge: Can players collect and craft tokens from nearby locations to finally make one of sufficiently high value?

### Steps

- [x] copy main.ts to reference.ts for future reference
- [x] delete everything in main.ts
- [x] put a basic leaflet map on the screen
- [x] Removed random Caches, Spawns and popups.
- [x] larger grid rendering
- [x] cleanded up UI
- [x] draw the player's location on the map
- [x] draw a rectangle representing one cell on the map
- [x] use loops to draw a whole grid of cells on the map
- [x] reskin of tokens and relocation of tokens being help (UI fixes)
- [x] Token spawn
- [x] Visual token rendering
- [x] earth spanning grid
- [x] zoom in/out buttons
- [x] memoryless rendering
- [x] move player
- [x] directional buttons
- [x] map panning to follow player
- [x] confirm memoryless rendering
