# CMPM 121 D3 Project

After the major refactoring from the previous commit, this game featues a token system that allows the user to explore different parts of the map near our classroom. Player collects tokens and crafts them to to obtain higher numbered tokens. 2+2 = 4, and 4+4 will result in the player obtaining an 8. The player wins when a value of 16 or higher is obtained.
